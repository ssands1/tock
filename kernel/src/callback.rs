/// Userspace app identifier.
///
/// This should be treated as an opaque type that can be used to represent an
/// application on the board without requiring an actual reference to a
/// `ProcessType` object. Having this `AppId` reference type is useful for
/// managing ownership and type issues in Rust, but more importantly `AppId`
/// serves as a tool for capsules to hold pointers to applications.
///
/// Since `AppId` implements `Copy`, having an `AppId` does _not_ ensure that
/// the process the `AppId` refers to is still valid. The process may have been
/// removed, terminated, or restarted as a new process. Therefore, all uses of
/// `AppId` in the kernel must check that the `AppId` is still valid. This check
/// happens automatically when `.index()` is called, as noted by the return
/// type: `Option<usize>`. `.index()` will return the index of the process in
/// the processes array, but if the process no longer exists then `None` is
/// returned.
///
/// Outside of the kernel crate, holders of an `AppId` may want to use `.id()`
/// to retrieve a simple identifier for the process that can be communicated
/// over a UART bus or syscall interface. This call is guaranteed to return a
/// suitable identifier for the `AppId`, but does not check that the
/// corresponding application still exists.
///
/// This type also provides capsules an interface for interacting with processes
/// since they otherwise would have no reference to a `ProcessType`. Very limited
/// operations are available through this interface since capsules should not
/// need to know the details of any given process. However, certain information
/// makes certain capsules possible to implement. For example, capsules can use
/// the `get_editable_flash_range()` function so they can safely allow an app
/// to modify its own flash.
